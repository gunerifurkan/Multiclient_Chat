# Multiclient_Chat
This is a C++ program that demonstrates the use of networking, multithreading, and socket programming to create a chat server on a Linux-based system. The server can simultaneously handle multiple client connections, each in a separate thread, and broadcasts messages received from one client to all others. The server can accept new connections even while managing existing ones. There are also error handling features to alert the server of any problems during socket creation, connection, or data transmission.
